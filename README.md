# jupyterlab_practice repository

The jupyterlab_practice repository is used to practice creating jupyter notebooks with various components.

The repository contains the assignment 7 notebooks pertaining to questions 11 and 12 of the assignment. Questions 11 and 12 involve creating a mean function in python and explaining the timeit command, respectively. An html version of the question 12 notebook was exported using the notebook and the corresponding file is also present in this reporsitory. In order to include screenshots of the questions into the assignment 7 notebook, multiple pull requests were used in order to merge the images from developer-1 to the main branch.

The repository also includes a license file and an environment file for reproducibility. The environment was named misnamed env_a8 although the name env_a7 would have been more informative.
